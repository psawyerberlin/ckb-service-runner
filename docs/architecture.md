   independent probes ──► weekly signed summary ──► stat cell on CKB
```

The runner is a **separate process and a separate install**. It never modifies
the `ckb` binary, its config or its data directory. A crash or exploit in a
service cannot take the node down, and the runner has its own release schedule.

## R1 — Node reputation ledger

Recorded per node, keyed by P2P peer ID (not IP):

- availability (% of probes answered, 7 / 30 / 365 days)
- sync lag behind chain tip
- software version, first-seen date
- region, country, hosting provider (ASN)
- later: service results (answered correctly and on time)

Design choices:

- **Several independent probes**, each signing its results. Phase 1 starts with
  one project-run probe; decentralising it is a Phase 2 goal.
- **Weekly summary on-chain**, details off-chain: the stat cell holds a summary
  and a hash of the full data set.
- **Only runner nodes** are ranked. Joining is a setting (default on) and is
  required to be assigned jobs.
- It is reputation, not proof — documented as such.

## R2 — Fully synced full node

Local check, in code, not configurable:

- node RPC must be localhost; remote URLs are refused
- before start and before every job: not in initial block download, tip within
  a few blocks of the best known tip, has outbound peers
- if a check fails: pause running jobs, start no new ones

Remote proof:

- the runner signs "service key X belongs to peer ID Y" with the node's P2P key
- probes request headers and blocks at random heights **over P2P**, plus tip
  challenges with a time limit
- failures lower the node's reputation (R1)

Residual gap: nobody can prove from outside that a node verified scripts.

## R3 — Secure execution

Services run in CKB-VM and only see a small set of host calls:

| Host call | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `chain_read` | read chain state from the local node |
| `request_recv` | receive a job |
| `sign` | ask the host to sign with the service key (service never sees keys) |
| `kv_get` / `kv_put` / `kv_delete` | own storage namespace (R4) |
| `delete_on_consume` | register deletion when a given cell is consumed |

Deliberately absent: outbound network, file system, processes, clock beyond
block time. Cycle, memory, concurrency and storage limits come from config.

This interface is the main candidate for an RFC.

## R4 — Persistent service storage

- namespace per service code hash (and, for CRT, per switch cell)
- directory outside the node's data dir; survives restarts and resyncs
- atomic writes; encrypted at rest with a runner-held key
- per-service and total quotas; over quota returns an error
- event-driven deletion runs even when the service is stopped; deletions are
  logged (time and cell, never content)
- entries marked secret are excluded from backups and exports

Known limit: deletion is enforced by honest software, not by maths. Mitigations
are node diversity, bonding/slashing on leaks, and thresholds.

## Operator safety rules

- **Allowlist, not auto-discovery.** Only code hashes the operator approved run.
- **One payout address, no wallet in the runner.** Any lock: multisig, JoyID…
- **The node always wins.** Services pause while syncing or under load.
